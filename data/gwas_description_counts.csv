"Familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency is a rare genetic disorder is which a person lacks the enzyme lipoprotein lipase, a protein needed to break down fat molecules. Deficiency of this enzyme prevents affected individuals from properly digesting certain fats. This results in the accumulation of fatty droplets called chylomicrons in the blood and an increase in the blood concentration of triglycerides. Symptoms include episodes of abdominal pain, recurrent inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), abnormal enlargement of the liver and/or spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), and the development of skin lesions known as erruptive xanthomas. Familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency is caused by changes (mutations) in the LPL gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Treatment aims to control symptoms and blood triglyceride levels with a very low-fat diet. Treatment for individual symptoms (i.e. pancreatitis) involves following established treatment guidelines.",55

Causes the release of histamine from basophils and activates eosinophils. May activate several chemokine receptors including CCR1, CCR3, CCR4 and CCR5. One of the major HIV-suppressive factors produced by CD8+ T-cells. Recombinant RANTES protein induces a dose-dependent inhibition of different strains of HIV-1, HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). The processed form RANTES(3-68) acts as a natural chemotaxis inhibitor and is a more potent inhibitor of HIV-1-infection. The second processed form RANTES(4-68) exhibits reduced chemotactic and HIV-suppressive activity compared with RANTES(1-68) and RANTES(3-68) and is generated by an unidentified enzyme associated with monocytes and neutrophils (PubMed:16791620, PubMed:1380064, PubMed:8525373, PubMed:9516414, PubMed:15923218). May also be an agonist of the G protein-coupled receptor GPR75, stimulating inositol trisphosphate production and calcium mobilization through its activation. Together with GPR75, may play a role in neuron survival through activation of a downstream signaling pathway involving the PI3, Akt and MAP kinases.

"A tendency to fall or the inability to keep oneself from falling; imbalance. The retropulsion test is widely regarded as the gold standard to evaluate postural instability, Use of the retropulsion test includes a rapid balance perturbation in the backward direction, and the number of balance correcting steps (or total absence thereof) is used to rate the degree of postural instability. Healthy subjects correct such perturbations with either one or two large steps, or without taking any steps, hinging rapidly at the hips while swinging the arms forward as a counterweight. In patients with balance impairment, balance correcting steps are often too small, forcing patients to take more than two steps. Taking three or more steps is generally considered to be abnormal, and taking more than five steps is regarded as being clearly abnormal. Markedly affected patients continue to step backward without ever regaining their balance and must be caught by the examiner (this would be called true retropulsion). Even more severely affected patients fail to correct entirely, and fall backward like a pushed toy soldier, without taking any corrective steps.",16

"A bundle branch block refers to a defect of the heart's electrical conduction system in which the bundle branch may cease to conduct electrical impulses appropriately. This results in altered pathways for ventricular depolarization. Since the electrical impulse can no longer use the preferred pathway across the bundle branch, it may move instead through muscle fibers in a way that both slows the electrical movement and changes the directional propagation of the impulses. As a result, there is a loss of ventricular synchrony, ventricular depolarization is prolonged, and there may be a corresponding drop in cardiac output. When heart failure is present, a specialized pacemaker may be used to resynchronize the ventricles",7

"Prurigonodularis (PN) is a skin disease in which hard crusty lumps are formed on the skin that itches intensely. Repetitive rubbing, scratching, and touching results in more lesions in the skin. The itching is so intense that people scratch themselves to the point of bleeding or pain. The lumps formed in the skin are hard, and have about a half inch across, with a dry and rough top that is often scratched open. They tend to be located in the areas most easily reached and are worse on the outer sides: arms, shoulders and legs. The trunk, face and even palms can also be affected. The exact cause is unknown but some factors triggering PN include liver and kidneys problems, nervous and mental conditions and other skin diseases. Prurigo nodulares, in some cases, can be seen in other diseases such as lymphoma, chronic autoimmune cholestatic hepatitis, HIV infection, severe anemia,or a chronic kidney disease-related itching known as uremic pruritus. Treatment is very difficult, and may include corticoids, antihistaminic and other medication such as thalidomide and similar (Lenalidomide). In some cases, cryotherapy, photochemotherapy and habit reversal therapy for the itch-scratch cycle has improved the symptoms. PN can last for many years, and the itching is so intense that may affect all the everyday activities.",3

"quantification in blood of the transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase VEGFR2, expressed by endothelial cells. Tyrosine-protein kinase that acts as a cell-surface receptor for VEGFA, VEGFC and VEGFD. Plays an essential role in the regulation of angiogenesis, vascular development, vascular permeability, and embryonic hematopoiesis. Promotes proliferation, survival, migration and differentiation of endothelial cells. Promotes reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Isoforms lacking a transmembrane domain, such as isoform 2 and isoform 3, may function as decoy receptors for VEGFA, VEGFC and/or VEGFD. Isoform 2 plays an important role as negative regulator of VEGFA- and VEGFC-mediated lymphangiogenesis by limiting the amount of free VEGFA and/or VEGFC and preventing their binding to FLT4. Modulates FLT1 and FLT4 signaling by forming heterodimers. Binding of vascular growth factors to isoform 1 leads to the activation of several signaling cascades. Activation of PLCG1 leads to the production of the cellular signaling molecules diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and the activation of protein kinase C. Mediates activation of MAPK1/ERK2, MAPK3/ERK1 and the MAP kinase signaling pathway, as well as of the AKT1 signaling pathway. Mediates phosphorylation of PIK3R1, the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and activation of PTK2/FAK1. Required for VEGFA-mediated induction of NOS2 and NOS3, leading to the production of the signaling molecule nitric oxide (NO) by endothelial cells. Phosphorylates PLCG1. Promotes phosphorylation of FYN, NCK1, NOS3, PIK3R1, PTK2/FAK1 and SRC (Uniprot). Variations in this gene are associated with Hemangioma, capillary infantile (OMIM label).",2

Typical seizures consist of a characteristic aura that is frequently a rising epigastric sensation associated with emotional disturbances, illusions, and autonomic symptoms (widened pupils, palpitations), progressive impairment of consciousness, oro-alimentary automatisms (lip smacking, chewing, licking, tooth grinding), behavioral arrest, head deviation, dystonic postures, hand and verbal automatisms.

Initially, seizures are easily controlled with antiepileptic drugs, later they frequently become refractory and associated with progressive behavioral changes and memory deficits.",2
