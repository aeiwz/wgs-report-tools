Cytokine with a wide variety of biological functions. It is a potent inducer of the acute phase response. Plays an essential role in the final differentiation of B-cells into Ig-secreting cells Involved in lymphocyte and monocyte differentiation. Acts on B-cells, T-cells, hepatocytes, hematopoietic progenitor cells and cells of the CNS. Required for the generation of T(H)17 cells. Also acts as a myokine. It is discharged into the bloodstream after muscle contraction and acts to increase the breakdown of fats and to improve insulin resistance. It induces myeloma and plasmacytoma growth and induces nerve cells differentiation.",6
"A slow growing neuroendocrine tumor, composed of uniform, round, or polygonal cells having monotonous, centrally located nuclei and small nucleoli, infrequent mitoses, and no necrosis. The tumor may show a variety of patterns, such as solid, trabecular, and acinar. Electron microscopy shows small secretory granules. Immunohistochemical studies reveal NSE, as well as chromogranin immunoreactivity. Malignant histology (cellular pleomorphism, hyperchromatic nuclei, prominent nucleoli, necrosis, and mitoses) can occasionally be seen. Such cases may have an aggressive clinical course. Gastrointestinal tract and lung are common sites of involvement.",4
"Is the quantification of phytosterol, plant derived cholesterol like compounds.",3
Quantification of the glycoprotein erythropoetin typically in the blood,3
quantification of the activity of enzymes from the arylesterase family. Low measurements have been associated with cardiovascular risk - http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/22982463,2
Ontology not covered,2
"Is a quantification of alphamacroglobulins 1 and/or 2, glycoproteins with a molecular weight of approximately 620,000 to 680,000. Precipitation by electrophoresis is in the alpha region. They include alpha 1-macroglobulins and alpha 2-macroglobulins. These proteins exhibit trypsin-, chymotrypsin-, thrombin-, and plasmin-binding activity and function as hormonal transporters. Chronic kidney disease can result in the leakage of alphamacroglobulins into the blood.",1
"Is a quantification of any of the alpha globulin class of proteins, typically in serum.",1
"Is a quantification of Fructose-Bisphosphate Aldolase,is an enzyme catalyzing a reversible reaction that splits the aldol, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, into the triose phosphates dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP).",1
A form of hypertension with early onset relative to normal range for a given population.,1
