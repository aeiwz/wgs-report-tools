These deposits can also be a byproduct of senescence (ageing). However, large numbers of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are characteristic features of Alzheimer's disease. Abnormal neurites in senile plaques are composed primarily of paired helical filaments, a component of neurofibrillary tangles.[3] The plaques are variable in shape and size, but are on average 50 µm in size.[4] In Alzheimer's disease they are primarily composed of amyloid beta peptides."
